# Jane_Austen_Text_Generator

Create a character RNN to generate text. The RNN is trained on Jane Austen novels (Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, and Emma). The book .txt files are downloaded from Project Gutenberg and processed in the Prepare_corpus notebook. A training and validation/test corpus are created and the .txt files are available in the repository.
